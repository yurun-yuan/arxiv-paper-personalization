  This paper proposes a model-agnostic method for identifying Signal Regions (SR) in high-energy physics, particularly in the search for new particles when prior domain knowledge is lacking. By treating the signal events as localized high-frequency features, the approach utilizes density ratio learning to efficiently define SRs in high-dimensional feature space, demonstrated through simulated event data.

  The focus on theoretical hard clustering methods using likelihood does not align with the user's interests in reinforcement learning or empirical work, making it largely irrelevant.

- Summary
  
  This paper introduces a hard clustering approach that relies on likelihood measures instead of traditional distance metrics, demonstrating convergence through theoretical proofs. It also supports its findings with simulations and real data examples.
